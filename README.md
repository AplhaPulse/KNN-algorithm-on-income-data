# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation for Classification

This repository provides a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks.

## Purpose:

* Predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its k-nearest neighbors.
* Demonstrates a simple and intuitive classification algorithm.
* Provides a foundation for understanding non-parametric classification methods.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement the KNN classifier.
* Allows for customization of the 'k' parameter (number of neighbors).
* Implements distance metrics such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance.
* Provides functionality for model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix).

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
2.  Input your dataset (features and target variable).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`knn_classification.py`).
4.  Specify the desired 'k' value and distance metric.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs the classification accuracy.
    * A confusion matrix is generated to visualize classification performance.
    * Predictions for test data are provided.

## Key Concepts:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm.
* **'k' Parameter:** The number of nearest neighbors considered for prediction.
* **Distance Metric:** Measures the distance between data points (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
* **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories.
* **Lazy Learning:** The model does not learn a discriminative function from the training data but memorizes the training dataset instead.

## Output:

* Classification accuracy score.
* Confusion matrix.
* Predictions on the test set.
* Information about the parameters used (k value, distance metrics).
